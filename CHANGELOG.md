## Unreleased
### Breaking changes
* The way to dynamically generate the candidate list has changed.
  Instead of rebinding `selectrum-preprocess-candidates-function` and
  `selectrum-refine-candidates-function`, you simply pass a function
  as the COLLECTION argument to `selectrum-read`. This function takes
  one argument, the current user input, and returns the list of
  candidates as strings. Alternatively, it can return an alist whose
  `candidates` key is the candidate list and whose `input` key is a
  transformed user input to use for highlighting.

  As part of this change, `selectrum-refine-candidates-function` no
  longer can return an alist; that functionality should instead be
  moved to the CANDIDATES function. (This feature was never properly
  supported in the first place if you tried to use it in a way that
  can't be done equivalently in the CANDIDATES function.)

  See [#27].

### Enhancements
* In `read-file-name`, when a default is provided (for example in the
  `dired-do-rename` command), we actually use it as the initial
  contents of the minibuffer, which allows you to have convenient
  access to the default filename when that default file does not exist
  ([#25]).
* We now bind `minibuffer-completing-file-name` during
  `read-file-name`, in conformance with the standard Emacs interface
  ([#30]).

## Bugs fixed
* You can now use the undo system in the minibuffer. Previously,
  trying to do so would break Selectrum ([#31]).
* Passing a list of symbols to `selectrum-completing-read` works now.
* Previously, `selectrum-read-buffer` ignored its PREDICATE argument.
  This has now been fixed ([#32, #33]).
* Previously, `selectrum-read` would return nil when
  `selectrum-submit-exact-input` was used on an empty input and no
  `:default-candidate` was provided. Now the empty string is returned,
  in accordance with the `completing-read` API ([#34]).
