# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog].

## Unreleased
### Enhancements
* In `read-file-name`, when a default is provided (for example in the
  `dired-do-rename` command), we actually use it as the initial
  contents of the minibuffer, which allows you to have convenient
  access to the default filename when that default file does not exist
  ([#25]).
* We now bind `minibuffer-completing-file-name` during
  `read-file-name`, in conformance with the standard Emacs interface
  ([#30]).

## Bugs fixed
* You can now use the undo system in the minibuffer. Previously,
  trying to do so would break Selectrum ([#31]).
* Passing a list of symbols to `selectrum-completing-read` works now.
* Previously, `selectrum-read-buffer` ignored its PREDICATE argument.
  This has now been fixed ([#32, #33]).
